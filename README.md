Centrality computation using graph theory
In graph theory and network analysis, indicators of centrality identify the most important vertices within a graph. 
Applications include identifying the most influential person(s) in a social network, key infrastructure nodes in the Internet or urban networks, and super-spreaders of disease. Centrality concepts were first developed in social network analysis, and many of the terms used to measure centrality reflect their sociological origin.They should not be confused with node influence metrics, which seek to quantify the influence of every node in the network.
